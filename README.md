## Week 2 - October 24th, 2023:
During the second week of our project development, our group engaged in a constructive meeting with an OCBC representative to discuss our proposed features. We received valuable feedback that guided us in refining our focus. Consequently, we decided to concentrate our efforts on integrating our solutions into OCBC's web application, with particular emphasis on developing keybinds and gesture/eye tracking features.

I found the discussion to be exceptionally productive, offering a clear direction for our development efforts. The decision to prioritize keybinds and gesture-based features aligns well with our goal of enhancing accessibility for users with impaired mobility. This week's interactions with the OCBC representative have provided us with a more targeted vision for the project, and I believe this focused approach will contribute significantly to our development progress.

On the technical front, our team has completed an Inception deck, ensuring that everyone is on the same page and that our project aligns with OCBC's expectations. We are committed to delivering a proof of concept for the speech-to-text feature to further validate our approach before moving forward with full-scale development.

#### OAL Reflection:

This week's OAL sessions were particularly enriching, covering essential topics such as design thinking and the Inception deck.

The design thinking OAL, coupled with my completion of the IBM Design Thinking courseware, provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the methodology's various phases and its practical applications. This knowledge has proven invaluable in shaping our project's development strategy, ensuring a user-centric and problem-solving approach.

The Inception deck OAL further equipped me with the skills needed to construct a comprehensive project overview. This structured understanding was immediately applied in our team's collaborative creation of the Inception deck. The exercise not only facilitated effective problem-solving but also strengthened our ability to communicate our project's goals and objectives.

In addition, the insights gained from the OAL sessions on Agile methodologies, prototyping tools like Figma and Adobe XD, and UI/UX design principles have deepened my understanding of these crucial aspects of project development. I am eager to apply this newfound knowledge to our portfolio development project, ensuring a robust and user-friendly end product.

Overall, Week 2 has been a dynamic blend of practical project development and theoretical learning through OAL, positioning our team for success in the upcoming phases of our OCBC accessibility project.

## Week 3 - October 31th, 2023:
In the third week of our project development, our group engaged in a meaningful consultation with the OCBC Coach to assess our progress over the past two weeks. Taking into account the feedback and insights gained, we decided to reallocate our focus, placing greater emphasis on developing the voice command and keybind features. This strategic shift was prompted by the limitations we identified in the capabilities of the previously proposed eye-tracker-controlled cursor.

As we delved into the development phase, our group successfully initiated the implementation of these primary features. We have made substantial strides in refining the voice command functionality and key bind features, aligning them more closely with our vision for improving OCBC's online banking accessibility.

One of the key organizational enhancements we introduced this week was the adoption of a Trello board. This board serves as a centralized hub for tracking tasks, ensuring transparency, and facilitating better collaboration among team members. My assigned task for the week involved contributing to the voice recognition feature, a responsibility I found both challenging and rewarding.

On the coding front, our team made significant progress. I am pleased to share that I managed to build out the front end for the landing page and login/sign-up pages. This achievement marks a pivotal milestone in our development process, laying the foundation for a user-friendly and accessible interface.

Overall, I consider this week to be exceptionally productive, setting a strong foundation for our upcoming participation in the Hackathon in Week 5. The continuous alignment with OCBC's expectations and the iterative development approach reflect the agile principles we've embraced in our project management.

#### OAL Reflection:

This week's OAL sessions delved into the intricacies of Software Design and architecture, with a particular focus on system diagrams and software design patterns. Understanding how computer systems connect through system diagrams provided valuable insights into our ongoing project, guiding our decisions on feature implementation and overall system structure.

In the Software Design & Architecture OAL, the exploration of design patterns, such as singleton, prototype, builder, facade, and factory, broadened my understanding of alternative approaches to software design. Learning about these patterns enhanced my comprehension and provided practical insights into their applications. The discussion on design principles, including the four laws of UX and the 60-30-10 color rule, reinforced the importance of user-centered design and aesthetic considerations in our project.
