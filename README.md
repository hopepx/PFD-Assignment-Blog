### Goal: Enhancing OCBC App Accessibility for the Elderly
### Focus: Mobility impaired (amputees, limited arm movement)

#### Introduction:
In the pursuit of improving OCBC's online banking accessibility for individuals with impaired mobility, our team has made significant progress this week. We have developed a preliminary concept that addresses this issue, focusing on a voice command feature with a unique twist.

#### Project Overview:
Our project aims to create a more accessible online banking platform for individuals with mobility impairments. The central idea is to implement a chatbot with voice command capabilities, customizable interface options, biometric authentication, and speech-to-text functionality.

#### Team Member's Role:

Front-End Development: Xin Yin and Xue Wen

Back-End Development: Bi De, Ervin, and Keene

#### Key Accomplishments:
We have successfully crafted a comprehensive plan for our project, outlining the core features of our solution:

1. Voice Commands:
We have integrated voice recognition technology into our chatbot, allowing users to perform various banking tasks using voice commands. This hands-free interaction method is especially designed to assist individuals with limited arm movement.

2. Customizable Interface:
Our chatbot empowers users to personalize the application's interface, adjusting button sizes, fonts, colors, and contrast settings to meet individual preferences and the requirements of those with mobility impairments.

3. Biometric Authentication:
We've designed our chatbot to support biometric authentication methods like fingerprint scanning and facial recognition. This offers a secure and convenient login method, catering to the specific needs of users with mobility impairments.

4. Speech-to-Text:
Our chatbot includes a speech-to-text feature, enabling users to input text and commands using their voice. This hands-free functionality enhances accessibility for individuals with mobility impairments and provides a convenient alternative input method.

5. Simplified Navigation:
Our chatbot provides intuitive navigation with large buttons and user-friendly pathways, making the application more accessible for individuals with limited arm movement. This streamlined interface aims to enhance accessibility for those with mobility impairments.

#### Challenges Faced:
During our initial team discussion, we encountered challenges in terms of communication and collaboration. It was apparent that we needed more time to get comfortable with each other and voice our opinions freely. Although this initially slowed us down, we anticipate that as we continue working together, our collaboration will become more efficient and productive.

#### Upcoming Tasks:
In the coming weeks, we will delve into the development phase, implementing the features outlined in our plan. Our primary focus will be on refining the voice command feature and ensuring the chatbot's compatibility with OCBC's online banking platform.

#### Timeline:
We have established a timeline for our project, and we are committed to meeting the designated milestones. We anticipate regular updates on our progress, with the next reflection scheduled on Week 2

#### Conclusion:
In conclusion, we are excited about the direction our project is taking. Our chatbot concept promises to significantly improve OCBC's online banking accessibility for individuals with mobility impairments. Despite initial communication challenges, we are confident that as a team, we will become more cohesive and efficient in the upcoming weeks.

#### Next Steps:
Our next steps include initiating the development phase and ensuring that our chatbot's features align with OCBC's online banking platform. We will continue to update our team regularly and remain dedicated to our project's success.
